## ✍️ Creating a New Skill

### 1. YAML Frontmatter (2 fields only)

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: |
  What the skill does and when to use it.

  Include trigger keywords naturally in description:
  - Use when [context/keywords]
  - Focus on [specific areas]
  - Do NOT load for [wrong contexts]
---
```

**Rules:**
- `name`: lowercase-with-hyphens
- `description`: Be specific about WHEN to use (triggers + exclusions)

### 2. Content Guidelines

**Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**
- Concise > verbose (Claude is already smart)
- Principles over code examples
- Framework agnostic
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT

**If content > 500 lines:**
- Move details to `references/` folder
- Link from SKILL.md: "See [DETAILS.md](references/DETAILS.md)"

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Skill Name

## Purpose
One-sentence purpose.

## Core Principle
Key concept in 1-2 paragraphs.

## Section 1
### Guidelines
- Guideline with reasoning

## Common Mistakes
1. Mistake → Fix

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Check 1
- [ ] Check 2

## Key Takeaway
One-paragraph summary.
```

### 3. What NOT to Include

- README.md
- Installation guides
- Changelog
- Framework-specific code (React, Vue, Tailwind)
- Project-specific details (exact hex colors, etc.)
- Verbose explanations (Claude is smart)

### 4. What TO Include

- Universal principles (contrast ratios, spacing scales)
- Design patterns (mobile-first, progressive enhancement)
- Best practices (semantic HTML, WCAG guidelines)
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Validation checklists
- WHY principles matter (context and reasoning)

## 📦 Bundled Resources

### `references/` - Long documentation

Load as needed, not always in context:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (overview + navigation)
└── references/
    ├── advanced.md
    ├── api-reference.md
    └── examples.md
```

Link from SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Advanced Topics
See [ADVANCED.md](references/advanced.md) for complete guide.
```

### `scripts/` - Reusable code

For deterministic, repeatable operations:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    ├── validate.py
    └── generate.sh
```

### `assets/` - Output templates

Files used in output (not loaded to context):

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── assets/
    ├── template.html
    └── logo.png
```

## 💡 Writing Tips

1. **Concise is key** - Challenge each sentence: "Does Claude need this?"
2. **Principles over code** - Show patterns, not implementations
3. **Split when > 500 lines** - Move details to `references/`
4. **Description = trigger** - Include keywords naturally in description
5. **Framework agnostic** - Works for React, Vue, vanilla, etc.
6. **Explain WHY** - Context matters more than rules
